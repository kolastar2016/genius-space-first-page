This is my practice for Landing page.

I use VScode editor.
In place with it I run extensions such as Live Server and Live Sass Compiler

Main file for launching the page index.html
In the scss folder you will find the main.scss file.
It contains all the files in this directory
Next, all files with the scss extension were collected and minimized in the css folder
Next, the css is included in the header index.html

In the project you will find js, images, fonts folders.
In the js folder there are three js files that are responsible for the modul window, the burger menu for the mobile version and the slider.
In the images folder you will put on all the cards that are connected to the website.
All the fonts are in the fonts folder. We include these font styles on the site via scss
